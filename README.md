# Pig-Game

The Pig game is a simple dice game that can be played with two or more players.
The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain score, typically 100 points.
Here are the basic rules for playing the Pig game:

<h3>Gameplay : </h3>

Players take turns rolling the die.
On your turn, you can choose to roll the die as many times as you like in a single turn.
Each time you roll the die, the number rolled is added to your current turn's score.

However, if you roll a 1 on the die, you lose all the points you've accumulated during your turn, and your turn ends. It's called "pigging out" or "rolling a pig."

To avoid losing your points, you can choose to end your turn voluntarily after any roll and add the accumulated points to your total score.
The game continues with the next player taking their turn.
The first player to reach the agreed-upon winning score (usually 100 points) wins the game.

<h3>Additional Rules : </h3

If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their points for that turn and their turn ends.

If a player rolls two consecutive 1s (i.e., rolls a 1 on two consecutive turns), they lose all their accumulated points for the entire game, and their turn ends.

Some variations allow players to accumulate points across multiple turns before deciding to end their turn voluntarily.
The first player to reach the winning score must have their final turn completed, allowing all other players one more turn to try to surpass their score.

The game is often played with variations and house rules, so you can adjust the rules to your liking.
The key strategy in Pig is deciding when to stop rolling and bank your points to avoid the risk of rolling a 1 and losing them.
It's a fun and quick game that requires a mix of luck and strategy.
