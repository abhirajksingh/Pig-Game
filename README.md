# Pig-Game
<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
Players take turns rolling the die.
On your turn, you can choose to roll the die as many times as you like in a single turn.
Each time you roll the die, the number rolled is added to your current turn's score.

However, if you roll a 1 on the die, you lose all the points you've accumulated during your turn, and your turn ends. It's called "pigging out" or "rolling a pig."

To avoid losing your points, you can choose to end your turn voluntarily after any roll and add the accumulated points to your total score.
The game continues with the next player taking their turn.
The first player to reach the agreed-upon winning score (usually 100 points) wins the game.
